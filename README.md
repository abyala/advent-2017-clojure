# Advent of code 2017

This is an implementation of the [2017 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017) that I'm using as a way of
learning Clojure. As this is my very first project, it's hardly "good code."

# Potential Improvements

- Pull out data files from application files
- Separate test code from application code, once I know how 
- Run the full test suite all at once
